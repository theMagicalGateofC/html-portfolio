<h1>MY Favorite Series by Alexandra</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Series of all times</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Modern Family</h3>
<p>It shows in a very funny way how a family look like. <br />That we are all uniqe, but it should be acept from the others. </p>

<h3>The Big Bang Theorie</h3>
<p>Here is a good example how we can handle with friends, and that we change with the time.</p>

<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>Is a good solution to go back to our teanager times and see a horroristic adventure.</p>
